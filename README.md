# CodeWars Solutions

This repository contains my solutions to coding challenges from CodeWars. CodeWars is a platform that provides programming challenges of varying difficulty levels. 

Each solution is written in a specific programming language and organized into separate folders based on the kata (challenge) name. This makes it easy to navigate and find solutions for specific problems.

## Folder Structure

The repository follows the following folder structure:
- `/kata-level` represents the name of the kata (challenge).
- `/language` represents the programming language used for the solution.
- `solution.file` contains the code solution for the kata.

## Languages

Currently, the repository includes solutions in the following programming languages:

- JavaScript

## Usage

Feel free to explore the solutions in this repository. You can browse through the folders to find the specific kata you are interested in. Each solution file contains the code solution for the respective kata.

Please note that these solutions are provided for reference purposes and may not always be the most optimal or efficient solutions. They represent my personal approach to solving the challenges and may not necessarily be the best solution for every scenario.
